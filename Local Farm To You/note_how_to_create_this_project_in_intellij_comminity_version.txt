1. create maven webapp archetype
2. add jersey dependency
3. web.xml is changed
4. web.xml specify jersey <init-param> according to Jersey tutorial
5. in pom.xml, the <build> tag specify the root url
6. url will be [localhost:8080/<build>/<url-pattern]/...]

7. For Intellij IDE, open Project Structure->Module->Source, change src and test root directory

... // something happens here

n. deploy (move) the .war architect to Tomcat container

warning:
1. because in web.xml, the url pattern is [/*], which overlaps the namespace for index.jsp, therefore, index.jsp won't show unless <url-pattern> is changed to something other than [/*].
